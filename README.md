### BetterHealth (better name pending)

Mobile DApp that improves the ER experience. _Better Health_ finds the most efficient Emergency Room near you by clicking the `I have a medical emergency button` by using its algorithms to find the most suitable Hospital based in distance and their median reponse time at the moment of your emergency. Also it provides a QR code that the care providers can scan once you arrive so you don´t have to fill out any personal information while you are dealing.
