### BetterInfra

Web-dapp for government officials, community leaders and the citizens that keeps track of the past, present and future of Puerto Rico's infrastructure thanks to the unique capabilities of block-chain. This allows everyone to be prepared for the challenges presented by climate change. It will also track as if it were an e-shop the current status of all aids being sent to PR in an open ledger in the blockchain for everyone to check the status of the help, from the moment it's being sent to the moment it arrives to the intended area.
